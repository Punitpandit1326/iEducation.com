            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such
                as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development
                of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical
                thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education
                results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In
                a
                slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this
                process:
                the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the
                transmission of
                cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new
                ideas
                such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational
                skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that
                the
                potential for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary
                education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their
                creation of
                state-level programs and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of
                primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.
                Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of
                schools
                offering elementary education (Grades 1â€“8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under
                private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education
                Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are
                'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided.
